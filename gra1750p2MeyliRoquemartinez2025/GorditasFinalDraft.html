            <h3>Cooking Steps</h3>
            <p>When it comes to making carne asada gorditas the process is quite simple!</p>
			<ul>-Grab a couple garlic cloves and roast them till they are soft; then grind the garlic cloves into a paste after roasting</ul>
			<ul>-Add the cilantro, juice of 2 limes, 1 orange, vinegar, olive oil, spices. Mix well, making sure you scrape all the garlic paste from the bottom</ul>
			<ul>-Marinade the paste into the skirt steak in the fridge for 2-4 hours </ul>
			<ul>-Smash the avocados then add the rest of the guacamole ingredients together and set it aside. To keep it from browning, place saran wrap right on top to seal it so there is no oxygen. This keeps it from oxidizing.</ul>
			<ul>-Combine the maseca and slowy pour warm water until dough is soft</ul>
			<ul>-Divide the dough into 8 pieces and form a pocket to fill with whatever cheese you like!</ul>
			<ul>-Form into balls and proceed to flatten 1/8-1/4 inch discs</ul>
			<ul>-Grill the carne asada or cook it on a cast iron skillet with the onions and jalapenos left over</ul>
			<ul>-Cut the carne asada into small chunks and squeeze some lime juice all over</ul>
			<ul>-Fry the gorditas neutral (325 degrees fahrenheit)</ul>
			<ul>Carefull cut into the gorditas but only half way</ul>
			<ul>-Stuff with guac, queso fresco, lettuce, carne asada, crema, and salsa</ul>
			<ul>-Finally...Enjoy!!!</ul>
